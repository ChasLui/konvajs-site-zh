Welcome to the Konva's documentation. This documentation will help you get started fast.
If you get any problems when using Konva you can ask me on [GitHub](https://github.com/konvajs/konva/issues).

## What's Konva?

Konva is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that extends the 2d context
by enabling canvas interactivity for desktop and mobile applications.

Konva enables high performance animations, transitions, node nesting, layering, filtering,
caching, event handling for desktop and mobile applications, and much more.

You can draw things onto the stage, add event listeners to them, move them,
scale them, and rotate them independently from other shapes to support high performance
animations, even if your application uses thousands of shapes.

This project began as a GitHub fork of [KineticJS](https://github.com/ericdrowell/KineticJS).
