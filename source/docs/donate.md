title: How to support and donate to Konva project?

---


Hello, my name is Anton. I am core maintainer of `Konva` framework.

### If you want to support development of `Konva` and all its ecosystem tools like `react-konva` and `vue-konva` you can use [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lavrton), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/konva) or [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/lavrton).

If you want to make a small one time donation please use [PayPal](https://paypal.me/lavrton)

I am spending a large amount of time to support `Konva` users and develop new versions with bugs fixes and new features.

If you are making money, by using `Konva` in your project, it makes sense to support `Konva` development. By doing this you will make sure that you have a good quality and maintained framework.

Even if you are not making money from your project but `Konva` saved you a lot of time, it will be very kind to support it.
