React Konva is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). It provides declarative and reactive bindings to the
[Konva Framework](http://konvajs.github.io/).


An attempt to make [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) work with the HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have similar declarative markup as normal React and to have similar data-flow model.

Currently you can use all `Konva` components as React components and all `Konva` events are supported on them in same way as normal browser events are supported.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-konva konva --save
```
